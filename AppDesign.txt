Scrabble Scoreboard App

**********Design************

W - Walk thhrough - Requirements and the big picture

1. Menu where you can choose the amount of players, then allow to enter the players' names
2. Another window should allow to play rounds in which we enter the amount of points scored 
by each player during that round.
3. This second window should allow to visualise the subtotal in a pop up window if desired
4. There should be a button that allows to end the game and display all scores and congratulate the winner.

Extension goals: 
1. Allow players to save their users history: name, amounts of games won and the scores in each game.
2. Keep records in a database so we can retrieve a history of games won by each player
3. Allow a random picker to tell which user starts first. This user should be the first to the left and organise
   the other users according to their random number score.
4. A tailored message to display who the winner was and give messages depending upon score gap between the winner
   and the other users, such as "that was close", "Player 1 is killed it".
5. Add message generator based on current round scores. Such as, killed it!!!!. or Savage score.
6. Use some more advanced UI, could be winforms videos with plug ins, or maybe make it web based with Razor pages.

O - Open up requirements - Ask questions about the details

1. Is there a limit of players? 2-4 players as per Scrabble rules
2. Where do we keep the info? List of round and player, perhaps
3. How many windows do we need? Three main windows
4. Are we going to use TDD? Yes, adding a unit test project and TDD from the start
5. Are we going to need a library? ClassLibrary as it might be used with other UI later on.
6. Are going to need data validation? Yes, we don't want the program to crash unnecessarily
7. Is there a minimum amount of players? 2
8. Minimum score per round? 0
9. Maximum score per round? 130 as the highest bingo for 7 letter scrabble has been 128, so unlikely amateurs get 
more
10. Can we undo a round if the scores entered were wrong? Maybe, depends on how we keep count of the scores.

U - User interface design

1. Initial window welcoming to the app, asking for the amount of players.
2. Second window asking for the name of the players
3. Third window is the round window. We need four 2-4 labels and 2-4 textboxes where we can type the scores. This 
   window should show at the top which round it is. There should be a button for finishing the game, at which point
   a pop up window shows the that the final scores and congratulates the winner.

L - Logic - 

1. A class library:
	a. Player class: prop {Name: string, Current Score: int > 0, Subtotal Score: int > 0}
	b. Game class: prop {Amount of Players: Player} We need three forms, for 2, 3 and 4 players, we load the
	one required.
	c. Round class {CurrentRound: int} {CurrentTopPlayer} {CurrentScores}
	d. Messages class: {text: string} {Winner: Player} {Score} 

2. List of Methods

- Method 1 -> Sums the scores done!!!
 

score = score +roundScore


- Method2: -> Decide the round winner done!!!

For 2 players:

if (player1.Score > player2.Score)
winner = player1
	
else
winner = player2

return winner;

For 3 players: use Method 2 and compare with player 3 score done!!!

For 4 players: use Method 2 for player1 and player and again for player 3 and 4, then compare the two winners using 
the same method done!!!

- Method 3: method for creating a player -> we can use the constructor done!!!
- Methods 4, 5, 6: determine winner for 2, 3 and 4 players 
- Method 5: display the round scores
- Method 6: display the winner

****Validation Methods 

Method 1: validates against an empty string
Method 2: validates for the correct range of numbers
Method 3: validates for allowing integers only


3. UI Project:
	a. Initial Form
	b. Form for entering players names
	c. Round form
	d. Two pop windows. One for temporary subtotal and one for total of the game

D - Data design 
For now, no database so we will use a List to store the players' info including rounds scores and hence
the final score.

ToDo:
1. Finish data validation methods DONE!
2. Structured exception handling for null when equal scores in Calculations class methods. -> better if done in
the UI project.
3. Create initial form with amount of players DONE!!!
4. Create second form to enter players' names (MERGED IN THE FIRST FORM)
5. Round form that updates the round number and lets enter players scores, one button for entering values, another
   for pop with subtotal values DONE!!!
6. Final pop with congratulation message DONE!!!
